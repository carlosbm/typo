#Feature: Merge Articles
#  As a blog administrator
#  In order to keep blog clean and comprehensive
#  I want to be able to merge two articles into a new one
#
#  Background:
#    Flunk "unimplemented"
#    Given the blog is set up
#    And I am logged into the admin panel
# #   And Blog entrances are created
# #   And Blog entrance is created with title:text title1:text1
# #   And Blog entrance is created with title:text title2:text2
#
#  Scenario: Successfully write articles
#    Flunk "unimplemented"
#    Given I am on the first article edit page
#    Then I should see "Merge Articles"
#    When I fill in "merge_with" with "2"
#    Then I should see "Successfully merged articles"
#    When I go to the merged article page
#    Then I should see "text1"
#    And  I should see "text2"
